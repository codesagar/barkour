## Customization

### Replacing Dog Sprites

The current dog sprites (`dog1.svg` and `dog2.svg`) are placeholders. To use your own dog images:

1. Replace `assets/sprites/dog1.svg` with your first dog's 16x16 bitmap (PNG or SVG)
2. Replace `assets/sprites/dog2.svg` with your second dog's 16x16 bitmap (PNG or SVG)
3. Ensure the images have transparent backgrounds
4. The game will automatically scale them to 32x32 for display

**Recommended format**: PNG with transparency, 16x16 pixels

### Adjusting Game Difficulty

Edit `js/constants.js` to modify game parameters:

```javascript
// Make the game easier
INITIAL_SPEED: 4,           // Default: 6
SPEED_INCREMENT: 0.0005,    // Default: 0.001

// Make jumps higher
JUMP_VELOCITY: -12,         // Default: -10

// Space out obstacles more
MIN_OBSTACLE_DISTANCE: 300, // Default: 200
MAX_OBSTACLE_DISTANCE: 800, // Default: 600
```

### Changing Colors

Edit the color palette in `js/constants.js`:

```javascript
COLORS: {
    SKY_BLUE: '#5C94FC',
    GROUND_BROWN: '#C84C0C',
    PIPE_GREEN: '#00A800',
    // ... etc
}
```

## Game Mechanics

### Physics
- **Gravity**: 0.6 pixels/frame²
- **Jump Velocity**: -10 pixels/frame
- **Initial Speed**: 6 pixels/frame
- **Max Speed**: 13 pixels/frame
- **Speed Increase**: 0.001 pixels/frame

### Obstacles
- **Pipes**: Green pipes in various heights (40-80px)
- **Goombas**: Walking mushroom enemies (16x16)
- **Spawn Distance**: 200-600 pixels apart

### Scoring
- Score increases based on distance traveled
- +0.5 points per frame
- High score persists between sessions

## Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

Requires support for:
- HTML5 Canvas
- ES6 JavaScript
- localStorage
- CSS3

## Development

### Debug Mode

To enable hitbox visualization, uncomment the debug lines in:
- `js/character.js` (line ~66)
- `js/obstacle.js` (line ~23)

This will show collision boxes in red/blue for easier debugging.

### Performance

The game targets 60 FPS and uses:
- `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth animations
- Pixel-perfect rendering (no image smoothing)
- Efficient canvas clearing and redrawing
- Obstacle cleanup (removes off-screen objects)

## Known Issues

- None currently! Report issues if you find any.

## Future Enhancements

See `PRD.md` for a full list of potential future features:
- Power-ups (mushrooms, stars)
- Multiple worlds/backgrounds
- Sound effects and music
- Mobile touch controls
- Additional dog characters
- Achievements system
